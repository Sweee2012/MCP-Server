# ðŸ§  MCP Server Project

This project is an implementation of an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server**, built by following the YouTube tutorial: [Set Up MCP Server In Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g0z3DNi_fU). The server allows AI models like ChatGPT to interact with real-world tools and APIs by providing a standardized communication interface.
